# BTD6-Collection-Event-Macro
This is an autohotkey macro program that will farm the collection events automatically. This is not a finished product.

# REQUIREMENTS TO RUN:

- 2560x1440 Resolution
- Fast Track Mode enabled
- default key binds
- Benjamin unlocked
- at least one expert map unlocked
  
Probably needed (not tested):

- map visual effects off
- default cursor size

# INSTRUCTIONS
- Load game and navigate to menu screen (where you can click play, choose hero, see achievements, etc.)
- Run Start_Script.ahk
- When you want to stop, press = a few times

# USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
- THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.
- Although it is not likely you will get flagged as cheating, it is not impossible
- I am not responsible for any actions taken by NinjaKiwi on anyone's accounts
- Use cautiously, and only in singleplayer for best practice
- USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

# CAPABILITIES
- Can play every expert map on either impoppable or easy, see below on how to change difficulty
- Smart detection helps the loop to continue if you level up, fail, or get an advertisement (yes, there are ads for the DLC if you do not own them) 
- Will automatically select the event map for maximum rewards, but still works without an ongoing event
- Opens boxes when enough resources are collected, and keeps track of each rarity insta you obtain in a GUI
- Shows the current action being performed in the top right GUI
- (Advanced) Per-map difficulty selection by going into the mainscripts folder and editing collection_event_farm.ahk starting at line 95, instructions in the file

Some maps use cash drops to improve reliability. Even though you earn the money back, you may configure some maps on easy difficulty instead.

Maps that use cash drops on impoppable
- bloody puddles
- dark dungeons
- glacial trail
- tricky tracks
- workshop

No cash drop maps
- dark castle
- flooded valley
- infernal
- muddy puddles
- ouch
- quad
- ravine

- every map played on easy difficulty
