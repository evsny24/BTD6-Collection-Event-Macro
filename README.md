# BTD6-Collection-Event-Macro

# USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
- Although it is not likely you will get flagged as cheating, it is not impossible
- I am not responsible for any actions taken by NinjaKiwi on anyone's accounts
- Use cautiously, and only in singleplayer for best practice
- USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

# CAPABILITIES
- Can play every expert map on either impoppable or easy, with per-map difficulty selection
- Smart detection helps the loop to continue if you level up, fail, or get an advertisement (yes, there are ads for the DLC if you do not own them) 
- Will automatically select the event map for maximum rewards, but still works without an ongoing event
- Opens boxes when enough resources are collected, and keeps track of each rarity insta you obtain in a GUI
- Shows the current action being performed in the top right GUI

# NOTICE

Some maps use cash drops to improve reliability. Even though you earn the money back, you may configure some maps on easy difficulty instead.

Maps that use cash drops on impoppable
- bloody puddles
- dark dungeons
- glacial trail
- tricky tracks
- workshop

No cash drop maps
- dark castle
- flooded valley
- infernal
- muddy puddles
- ouch
