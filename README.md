# BTD6-Collection-Event-Macro
This is an autohotkey macro program that will farm the collection events automatically.

# REQUIREMENTS TO RUN:

Required:
- 2560x1440 Resolution
    - Some placements are pixel perfect, but don't worry; if your monitor is a lower resolution, you can emulate it. See below.
- Fast Track Mode enabled
    - It simply makes the process so much faster, but I am working to make this optional for better accesibility
- default key binds
    - In settings, reset to default
- Benjamin unlocked
- at least one expert map unlocked
  
Recommended:
- full monkey knowledge for impoppable mode especially
- map visual effects off for consistency
- default cursor size also for consistency

# INSTRUCTIONS
- Load game and navigate to menu screen (where you can click play, choose hero, see achievements, etc.)
- Run Start_Script.ahk
- When you want to stop, press = a few times

# USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
- THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.
- Although it is not likely you will get flagged as cheating, it is not impossible
- I am not responsible for any actions taken by NinjaKiwi on anyone's accounts
- Use cautiously, and only in singleplayer for best practice
- USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

# CAPABILITIES
- Can play every expert map on either impoppable or easy, see below on how to change difficulty
    - (Advanced) Per-map difficulty selection by going into the mainscripts folder and editing collection_event_farm.ahk starting at line 95, instructions in the file 
- Smart detection helps the loop to continue if you level up, fail, or get an advertisement (yes, there are ads for the DLC if you do not own them) 
- Will automatically select the event map for maximum rewards, but still works without an ongoing event
- Opens boxes when enough resources are collected, and keeps track of each rarity insta you obtain in a GUI
- Shows the current action being performed in the top right GUI

# NOTICE

Some maps use cash drops to improve reliability. Even though you earn the money back, you may configure some maps on easy difficulty instead.

Maps that use cash drops on impoppable
- bloody puddles
- dark dungeons
- glacial trail
- tricky tracks
- workshop

No cash drop maps
- dark castle
- flooded valley
- infernal
- muddy puddles
- ouch
- quad
- ravine
- sanctuary
- every map played on easy difficulty

# EMULATING 2560x1440 RESOLUTION

If your monitor is lower resolution than the script’s hardcoded resolution (2560×1440), you can create a **custom/high resolution** using your GPU software. Below are instructions for NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel GPUs.

| Step | NVIDIA (GeForce) | AMD (Radeon / Adrenalin) | Intel (Integrated / UHD) |
|------|-----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| **1. Open GPU Control Panel** | Right-click desktop → **NVIDIA Control Panel** | Right-click desktop → **AMD Software / Adrenalin** → **Settings (gear)** | Right-click desktop → **Intel Graphics Command Center** |
| **2. Go to Custom Resolution Section** | **Display → Change resolution → Customize… → Create Custom Resolution…** | **Display → Custom Resolutions → Create New** | **Display → Custom Resolutions → Add** |
| **3. Set Resolution & Refresh Rate** | Horizontal: 2560, Vertical: 1440, Refresh: 60Hz, Timing: Automatic / CVT-RB | Horizontal: 2560, Vertical: 1440, Refresh: 60Hz, Timing: Automatic / CVT-RB | Horizontal: 2560, Vertical: 1440, Refresh: 60Hz, Timing: Automatic |
| **4. Test Resolution** | Click **Test** → Confirm if screen works | Click **Save / Test** → Confirm if screen works | Click **Apply / Test** → Confirm if screen works |
| **5. Apply & Set as Primary (Optional)** | Back in **Change resolution**, select new resolution → **Apply** | Back in **Display**, select new resolution → **Apply** | Back in **Display**, select new resolution → **Apply** |
| **6. Set Windows Scaling** | Settings → System → Display → Scale = 100% | Settings → System → Display → Scale = 100% | Settings → System → Display → Scale = 100% |
| **7. Run BTD6** | Launch BTD6 on the new resolution (use **Windowed Fullscreen** if needed) | Launch BTD6 on the new resolution (use **Windowed Fullscreen** if needed) | Launch BTD6 on the new resolution (use **Windowed Fullscreen** if needed) |
| **Notes / Caveats** | If monitor is physically lower than resolution, image is downscaled; pixel-perfect placement still works | Same as NVIDIA; visuals may be slightly softer | Same as NVIDIA; visuals may be slightly softer |
